# propozitii-nostime

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fabian20ro/propozitii-nostime.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fabian20ro/propozitii-nostime)

Running it:

From a terminal that supports UTF-8
```
cd build/libs && java -jar propozitii-nostime.jar
```

Apparently setting your windows terminal font to Lucida and running
```
chcp 65001
```
should set your UTF to 8. I had issues with backspaces which don't happen anymore...
